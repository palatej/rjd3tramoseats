\arguments{
\item{x}{the specification.}

\item{approximation}{character: the approximation mode. When the ARIMA model estimated by TRAMO does not accept an admissible decomposition, SEATS: \code{"None"} - performs an approximation; \code{"Legacy"} - replaces the model with a decomposable one; \code{"Noisy"} - estimates a new model by adding a white noise to the non-admissible model estimated by TRAMO.}

\item{trend.boundary}{numeric: the trend boundary. The boundary beyond which an AR root is integrated in the trend component.
If the modulus of the inverse real root is greater than the trend boundary, the AR root is integrated in the trend component.
Below this value, the root is integrated in the transitory component.}

\item{seas.boundary}{numeric: the seasonal boundary. The boundary beyond which a negative AR root is integrated in the seasonal component.}

\item{seas.boundary.unique}{numeric: the seasonal boundary (unique). The boundary beyond which a negative AR root is integrated
in the seasonal component, when the root is the unique seasonal root.}

\item{seas.tolerance}{numeric: the seasonal tolerance. The tolerance (measured in degrees) to allocate the AR non-real roots
to the seasonal component (if the modulus of the inverse complex AR root is greater than the trend boundary
and the frequency of this root differs from one of the seasonal frequencies by less than Seasonal tolerance)
or the transitory component (otherwise).}

\item{ma.boundary}{numeric: the MA unit root boundary. When the modulus of an estimated MA root falls in the range (xl, 1),
it is set to xl.}

\item{bcasts, fcasts}{numeric: the number of backasts (\code{bcasts}) or forecasts (\code{fcasts}) used in the decomposition in periods (positive values) or years (negative values).}

\item{algorithm}{character: the estimation method for the unobserved components. The choice can be made from:
\itemize{
\item \code{"Burman"}: the default value. May result in a significant underestimation of the components' standard deviation,
as it may become numerically unstable when some roots of the MA polynomial are near 1;
\item \code{"KalmanSmoother"}: it is not disturbed by the (quasi-) unit roots in MA;
\item \code{"McElroyMatrix"}: it has the same stability issues as the Burman's algorithm.

\item{bias}{TODO.}
